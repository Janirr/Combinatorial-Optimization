# Combinatorial-Optimization
## Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.

## How to run it:
### To insert matrix from LINUX terminal:
```
cat > test
```
### And run it in python
```
python3 main.py
```
